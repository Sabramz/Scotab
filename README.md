### Bruh

Currently working on - A blog/media website using sveltekit, docker, and AWS Fargate Serverless.

Also working on - College!

Currently learning - AWS

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on - Anything interesting. I want to contribute to open source (specifically svelte/sveltekit, but I'm a bit too dumb right now). Building a startup, SaaS, company, etc. would be fun too.
